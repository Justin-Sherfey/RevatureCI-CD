Alarm - For the alarm implementation we used a priority queue to store Sleep Threads, which was an object
we defined to encapsulate a KThread and wakeTime. In our timerInterrupt we made sure that SleepQueue
was not empty and that the machine timer had not hit its reset threshold yet. If it had, then we forced
an interrupt. For waitUntil we made sure that the x parameter was not 0 or negative, then we initialized
a new Sleep Thread with the current thread and the wakeTime, which was updated with the minimum number of
clock ticks to wait.
